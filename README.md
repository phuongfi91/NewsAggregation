## Project outline

A. News Stories Aggregator

B. Elevator pitch [max 400 characters]

Every time a new event happens in the world, plenty of news stories will follow.
Stories that report the same event can be obtained from multiple sources.
Some stories will be more popular, useful, relevant and accurate compare to others.
The challenge is to group those similar news stories together into 1 single event category and rank them to deliver the most useful story.
To make it more applicable, it's possible to implement a news feeding application which can cater to reader's interests and deliver the most useful/trending stories/articles.

C. Data: RSS news sources, interest keywords

D. Data analysis: TF/IDF, statistics, machine learning	

E. Communication of results: summarization & (web app | static output)

F. Operationalization: an application that can group news stories and filter them in accordance to user's interest keywords
